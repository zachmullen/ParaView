#  1. Create a list of Python files to be installed/copied.
#  2. Copy them to the binary directory. Since paraview cannot be built
#     in place, we must always copy the files to the binary directory.
#  3. Use Python's compileall to compile the copied files.

# Copy generated module files from VTK.
# To this first so we can replace some of the VTK files by ParaView
